Introduction
This project focuses on creating a software application for the Kean University eSports Arena for the workers to use
Main users of the site will be the arena workers and management
Students/coordinators would use the site for game download requests or reserving the main stage for events
Getting Started
Getting started and using this software application will be simple since all you would need if you are a worker is your login information. No prior installation required since this is all based on a website
Overview
This application is used to allow the workers to log each student who enters the arena and uses a game system. 
It will let them log the students ID number, pc they used, what time they came and what time they left
Some key features of the application are the daily log system, main stage reservation, and game download request
User Interface
The user interface of the website has been designed to be very simple for users to navigate and simple headers to know exactly what they are clicking and being sent to
Headings include: 
Login(following 2 headers appear once worker is logged in)
Daily Log
Computer Availability
Operation Hours
Game Download Request
Main Stage Reservation
Rules
FAQ
Functionality
This section includes an explanation of the functionality of each tab of the website
Login: User would input their username and password which will be generated by the arena manager
Daily Log: Worker would input each student's ID number, what game system they are using, the exact time they came in and the time they have left. Each can be inputted manually by the worker
Computer Availability: This function will serve as a guide for the workers to see which game systems are currently available for students to use. This tab serves no other purpose but to view which systems are available. It will be updated in real time as the workers input each students information
Operation Hours: This tab will be for all users to see as it will give detailed information on the times the arena is open for all students and what time they are open for competitive spectating
Game Download Requests: This tab can be used by everyone and will allow for the user to input a specific game they would like to add to the systems and which platform it is currently on. They would also input their information to get notified when their request has been confirmed
Main Stage Reservation: This tab serves a similar purpose to Game Download request but instead of requesting a game the user would reserve a date to use the main stage for an event. They would input their information to get a confirmation when their reservation has been submitted and confirmed.
Rules: This tab gives a detailed description of the rules for the arena for everyone who is in the space. This tab is accessible to all users
FAQ: This tab shows some of the most common questions asked in the arena to the workers. This tab is shown to everyone when accessing the website
Work In Progress
The core functionality of the project is finished but there is still functions to enhance and alter to create a fully functioning website for the arena
Some functions include:
Adding Kean database for easier access to student information for workers
NSF Scanner for easier log
Enhanced User Interface for daily log
